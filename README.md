ABSTRACT Augmented Reality (AR) is promising in providing individual learning support for students. However, it is currently unknown which
display technology is appropriate to use in classroom settings. In
this work, we investigate different AR displays and their usability challenges.
In a field study (N = 122) with eleven classes of sixth
graders from three schools, we compared the use of a smartphone
and tablet to a custom-built projector-camera setup called ProLamp. Our system enables in-situ spatial augmented reality (SAR)
feedback through Wizard of Oz to be projected directly into the
physical environment, employing a lamp-like design that blends
into educational settings. Our results show that all devices provided
high pragmatic qualities and motivation, with an increased user
experience for the ProLamp compared to the smartphone regarding
hedonic quality. This work shows that all investigated display types
are feasible for educational use in specific contexts, each showing
several tradeoffs.

## Overview
* **Hardware** contains all files required to 3D print all components of the ProLamp and a manual for construction.
* **Software** contains the Python package enabling further projects with the ProLamp (Calibration, MarkerTracking, Connection to Unity) and the scripts used for the Wizard Of Oz study described in the paper.
