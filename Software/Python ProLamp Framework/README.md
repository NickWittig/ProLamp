# ProLamp Code

The ProLamp Code repository provides the core components for integrating the ProLamp hardware with interactive applications. It includes Python scripts for calibration and marker tracking using OpenCV, as well as Unity scripts for real-time data communication and visualization.

## Overview
* **python-opencv** contains the Python code enabling further projects with the ProLamp (Calibration, MarkerTracking, Connection to Unity).

* **unity** contains the Unity code for receiving data from the python-opencv project to integrate into your main ProLamp Unity project.
